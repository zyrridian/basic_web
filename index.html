          <h2>Is Oxygen a Slow-Acting Poison?</h2>
          <p>
            We breathe oxygen to survive, but what if it's actually killing us
            slowly? Oxygen plays a vital role in cellular respiration, but it
            also causes oxidative stress, which leads to aging and cellular
            damage. Over time, this accumulation contributes to diseases and
            even our eventual death. Could we ever survive without it?

          <h2>Using Giant Mirrors in Space to See the Past</h2>
          <p>
            If we placed a giant mirror light-years away and looked at it with a
            powerful telescope, we could see Earth’s past due to the time light
            takes to travel. But how could we position such a mirror instantly,
            or is there already one in space? Could this be the key to seeing
            historical events as they happened?

          <h2>Could We Build a Dyson Sphere?</h2>
          <p>
            A Dyson Sphere, a hypothetical megastructure surrounding a star,
            could harness immense energy. But is it actually feasible? The
            materials, engineering, and physics behind this concept push the
            limits of what we know. If an advanced civilization built one, would
            we even notice?
